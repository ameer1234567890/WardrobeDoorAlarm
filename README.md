# Wardrobe Door Alarm

My wardrobe has a light that is automatically turned on, using a switch, when the door opens.
Sometimes, we keep the door open unknowingly, and waste electricity.
A separate Arduino is wired to the same switch so that it turns on along with the light, and beeps if left open for long.
This gives us a beep sound indicating that the wardrobe door is left open, thus saving electricity.
